 *
 * claim() is atomic: exactly one caller for a businessTransactionId gets `claimed: true`
 * and may run the connector. Every other caller gets the stored answer, or `claimed: false`
 * with no answer while the first run is still in progress. complete() stores the answer.
 *
 * A claim with no answer is never released. If the process stops after the connector ran
 * but before the answer was stored, the id stays unanswered and a repeat gets 409. Nothing
 * runs twice, and an operator resolves it.
